      "The explorers you're about to meet are part of something special called the Future Leaders of Amphibian Conservation. They're scientists who are just getting started in their careers. Some of them were students not long ago! The Amphibian Survival Alliance supports them with training, research projects, and chances to learn from experts around the world. These young conservationists are proof that you don't have to wait until you're grown up to make a difference. Who knows? Maybe one day YOU could be a Future Leader too!",
